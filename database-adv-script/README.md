# 📘 Advanced SQL: Complex Queries, Indexing, and Optimization

## 🧠 Overview

This guide dives deep into **advanced SQL techniques** to help you:

* Write complex and powerful queries
* Use indexes to speed up data retrieval
* Optimize query performance for large datasets

Mastering these concepts will enhance your ability to build efficient backend systems and handle real-world data problems.

## 🔍 1. Complex Queries

### ✅ **Definition**

Complex queries use advanced SQL operations such as **joins**, **subqueries**, **aggregations**, and **window functions** to retrieve or manipulate data across multiple tables.

---

### 🔗 Types of Complex Queries

#### 🧩 **Joins**

Used to combine data from multiple tables based on related columns.

| Type              | Description                                               |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `INNER JOIN`      | Returns only matching rows from both tables               |
| `LEFT JOIN`       | Returns all rows from the left table, with matching right |
| `RIGHT JOIN`      | Returns all rows from the right table, with matching left |
| `FULL OUTER JOIN` | Returns all rows when there is a match in either table    |

#### 🔁 **Subqueries**

A query nested within another SQL query.

* **Correlated Subquery**: Depends on the outer query.
* **Non-Correlated Subquery**: Executes independently.

#### 📊 **Aggregations**

Use SQL functions like:

* `COUNT`, `SUM`, `AVG`, `MAX`, `MIN`

#### 🪟 **Window Functions**

Used to perform calculations across rows without grouping:

* `ROW_NUMBER()`
* `RANK()`
* `PARTITION BY`

### 🛠 How to Write Complex Queries

1. **Understand Your Schema**: Know how tables are related (foreign keys, constraints).
2. **Break Down the Logic**: Write small queries for each part.
3. **Use CTEs or Aliases**: Makes queries more readable and maintainable.
4. **Test Iteratively**: Run your query in parts and verify outputs.

## ⚙️ 2. Indexing

### ✅ **Definition**

An index is a data structure that improves the speed of retrieval operations by creating fast lookup paths to data.

---

### 🧱 Types of Indexes

| Type                | Description                                   |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| **Primary Index**   | Auto-created for the primary key              |
| **Unique Index**    | Prevents duplicate values in a column         |
| **Composite Index** | An index on two or more columns               |
| **Full-Text Index** | Allows full-text search on textual content    |
| **Clustered Index** | Physically sorts table rows based on key      |
| **Non-Clustered**   | Logical index separate from actual table data |

---

### 🛠 How to Implement Indexing

* Identify columns used in:

  * `WHERE` clauses
  * `JOIN` conditions
  * `ORDER BY`
* Add an index:

  ```sql
  CREATE INDEX idx_user_email ON users(email);
  ```
* Use:

  * `EXPLAIN` (MySQL/PostgreSQL)
  * `SHOW INDEX` to analyze index usage

🧠 **Note**: Avoid adding too many indexes as they can slow down `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE`.

## 🚀 3. Query Optimization

### ✅ **Definition**

Optimization is the process of rewriting SQL queries and adjusting schema to reduce load time and system resource usage.

---

### ⚙️ Optimization Techniques

| Technique               | Benefit                                                   |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Query Refactoring**   | Simplifies logic and avoids redundant operations          |
| **Using Indexes**       | Reduces the time needed for data lookup                   |
| **Execution Plans**     | Helps identify slow parts of a query                      |
| **Limit Wildcards**     | Avoid `%search` patterns, which bypass indexes            |
| **Partitioning Tables** | Improves performance for large datasets                   |
| **Using LIMIT/TOP**     | Reduces data returned, saving memory                      |
| **Denormalization**     | Optimizes read-heavy operations by storing redundant data |

### 🛠 How to Optimize Queries

* Use `EXPLAIN` or `ANALYZE` to inspect the query's execution path
* Refactor long queries into smaller components or use CTEs
* Monitor and iterate — performance tuning is ongoing!
